Chen-Pang He (jdh8)'s bridge bidding systems
============================================
This repository contains my bidding systems.  These documents are in the Bridge
Bidding Markup Language (BML).  Please use [my fork][fork] for now until
gpaulissen/bml#21 gets fixes.

The below are my pet forcing club bidding systems.  I believe bidding 1♣ for
all strong hands is a superior treatment.
