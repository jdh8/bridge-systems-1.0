* Multi 2!d

Our Multi 2!d shows a 6-card weak two of either major.

2D-
2H = P/C
2S = P/C
2N = !INV+ (R)
3C = F, 5+!c
3D = F, 5+!d
3H = P/C
3S = P/C
3N = S/O
4C = !(R)
  4D = TRF, 6+!h
  4H = TRF, 6+!s
4D = !(R)
  4H = 6+!h
  4S = 6+!s
4H = S/O
4S = S/O

2D-2N-
3C = !MIN, 6+!h
3D = !MIN, 6+!s
3H = !MAX, 6+!s
3S = !MAX, 6+!h
